## What you need to run Astro on your system?
Node.js v18.14.1+
You can use something like nvm to work with different node versions, depending on your current setup, and change versions with ease.

Astro routes are created under the pages folder and each route should end in .astro .

Unlike many frameworks, Astro uses standard HTML <a> elements to navigate between pages (also called routes), with traditional page refreshes.
